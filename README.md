# Web_Scraper
A simple web scrapper program, written in python. It works with most websites and is quite dynamic but some websites don't allow bots to access them through web drivers. To know which website allows scraping, search for the website and when you're on the home page add "/robots.txt" to the web address and search it. You will find a thorough list of the allowed scrapings.
